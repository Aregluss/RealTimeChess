Some notes

-> constructor test
-> Actually test move function
-> Maybe think about adding assert to check viability of getColor()
-> Restructure tests
-> Fix the constructor for Squares + tie it into getMoveLocation()

Overarching comment, knight + pawn do not apply to these, implement these seperately

-> Moving off king line of sight (ally) (pinned)
	- Create instance variable called isVisible/Invisible 
		- On getMoveLocations, sets itself Invisible, then calls King's check, if King is in Check cannot move unless it can attack the threatening piece
		
-> Moving into king LoS (body block)
	-Check threatening piece's danger spots, if any piece can move into that danger spot, check is resolved
	
-> King Movement
	- check every spot the king can move's danger zones,
